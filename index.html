    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
    
        Hello, I'm Nwaloka Jessica, and I'm currently a student at Alt School, specializing in the School of Engineering. My journey into the world of technology began at a young age when I first became captivated by computers and how they work. I remember spending hours exploring different software, tinkering with settings, and trying to understand the logic behind the technology. This early curiosity quickly grew into a deep passion, guiding me toward a more formal education in the field.
        
        As I progressed in my education, I became increasingly fascinated by how technology can solve complex problems and drive innovation. This fascination led me to pursue engineering, where I could combine my love for technology with my desire to create solutions that make a difference. At Alt School, I'm honing my skills, learning from industry experts, and collaborating with like-minded peers. This experience is not just about gaining knowledge; it's about preparing myself for a future where I can contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
        
        I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to leveraging my education and passion to make a positive impact in the world of technology.
